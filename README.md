## About 

This is the mobile version 2.0 of the Proffy App using React Native and TypeScrit, where the user can register a account, log in and have two options, become a Proffy or take classes by one of our Proffys.
The goal in this app is to create connections between the professionals and people that want to learn about some subject.
